Description: A new metric named 'dependency heaviness' is proposed that measures the number 
    of additional dependency packages that a parent package brings to its child package 
    and are unique to the dependency packages imported by all other parents.  
    The dependency heaviness analysis is visualized by a customized heatmap. 
    The package is described in <doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btac449>. 
    We have also performed the dependency heaviness analysis on the CRAN/Bioconductor 
    package ecosystem and the results are implemented as a web-based database 
    which provides comprehensive tools for querying dependencies of individual R packages. 
    The systematic analysis on the CRAN/Bioconductor ecosystem is described in 
    <doi:10.1016/j.jss.2023.111610>. From 'pkgndep' version 2.0.0, the heaviness 
    database includes snapshots of the CRAN/Bioconductor ecosystems for many old R versions.
